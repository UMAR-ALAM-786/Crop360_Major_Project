# Crop360 | Holistic Plant & Crop Management | Final Year Major Project
(Diagnose | Decide | Predict)
Live Output: Oct 2024 – Dec 2024

# Description
Crop360 is an AI-driven agricultural platform that provides comprehensive support to farmers and agronomists. It helps them diagnose plant diseases, recommend suitable crops, and predict crop yields by analyzing data such as soil pH, sunlight exposure, geolocation, temperature, and humidity.
Trained on 200,000+ datasets, Crop360 delivers actionable insights with a 97% disease detection accuracy, aiming to reduce crop losses by up to 30%.

# Key Features
Plant Disease Detection: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images with 97% accuracy.

Crop Recommendation: Suggests the best crop to cultivate based on:

Soil characteristics: pH, type, nutrients

Climate data: rainfall, temperature, humidity

Geocoordinates and sunlight exposure

Yield Prediction: Estimates crop productivity using regression models trained on historical agricultural data.

User Interface: Built with Flask and Streamlit for a smooth and accessible user experience.

# Technologies Used
1. Python: Core programming language

2. Jupyter Notebook: Model development and testing

3. TensorFlow, Keras: Deep learning model implementation

4. scikit-learn: Machine learning and data modeling

5. NumPy, Pandas: Data preprocessing and manipulation

6. Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization

7. Streamlit, Flask: Web-based deployment

8. CNNs: For image-based disease detection

9. SDLC: Follows structured software lifecycle design
